# KNN_diabetic_dataset
This is a toy project to work with KNN algorithm. Dataset is deaibetic dataset.
Business problem: Given a set of medical condition for each person, we need to predict whether the person is diabetic or not. 
Evaluation metric: Accuracy

Steps involved:
1. Importing data
2. EDA
3. Preprocessing data
4. Training
5. Evaluation

Accuracy after model: 71%

This is a demo of KNN with very basic/minimal EDA and preprocessing steps. No data imputation, anomoly detection has been performed.
